### Hi! I'm Michael.
I'm a coding and technology fanatic. I've been in love with programming since the day programming was first introduced to me in the 6th grade. From then on I've been eager to learn new programming languages and concepts.

Right now I'm engrossed in a course where I'm learning the ins and outs of neural networks in TensorFlow, and how to code them from scratch.
