### Hi! I'm Michael.
I'm a coding and technology fanatic. I've been in love with programming and learning about coding since the day it was first introduced to me in the 6th grade. From then on I've been eager to learn new programming languages and concepts.

Right now I'm engrossed in a course where I'm learning the ins and outs of neural networks in TensorFlow, and how to code them from scratch.

I am proficient in using:
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Java
* JavaScript
* HTML
* PGP/GPG
* Linux

I've just started a GitHub page and will be uploading the projects I create here as I make/find them.
